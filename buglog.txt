CHECKPOINT 2.1:
b - status bar displaying top corner of maze instead of black screen
    - change target img value to accurately point to status bar location
b - text fills up entire status bar
    - set status bar height to 18
b - text displaying out of plane order, making the characters illegible
    - in show status bar, was incorrectly calculating p_off. Correct
      implementation has a constant p_off of 3 indicating that the buf
      is already filled out in modex order
b - masking funcs overwriting player image with black screen
    - in mazegame, was drawing and saving in the wrong order, leading
      to the black screen overwriting the mask and background image
b - overwriting player with black instead of the player block
    - drawing based on !player_mask instead of on player mask
b - player not masked at the beginning of the game, then the mask
    applies when the player starts moving
    - was not applying the player mask outside of the event loop,
      leading to no mask until the game is running
